=================================

This was a merging of two forms, using MeshMixer, 3DSMax, and Netfabb. I printed this using the Afinia UP machine in BR217.
For my two forms, I modeled a raccoon head and attached it to the 3D scanned bust of myself. It was difficult to get the mesh
to be water-tight, even after capping every hole in 3DSMax. I had to repair the file multiple times in Netfabb before it
was an acceptable, water-tight mesh.
